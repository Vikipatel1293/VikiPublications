## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- A dataset of student images

## Data Collection

The first step is to collect a dataset of student images. Ensure you have multiple images of each student in various lighting conditions and angles to improve the model's robustness.

## Model Architecture

We will use a CNN model to perform face detection and recognition. The model architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## Training the Model

### Data Preprocessing

- Resize images to a uniform size
- Normalize pixel values
- Split the dataset into training and validation sets

### Training

Use TensorFlow/Keras to define and train the CNN model. Monitor the training process to avoid overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to new images.

## Implementation

### Face Detection

Use OpenCV to detect faces in real-time video streams. Integrate the trained CNN model to recognize and mark attendance based on detected faces.

### Attendance System

Implement a system to log attendance based on recognized faces. Ensure the system is user-friendly and provides accurate attendance records.

## Conclusion

Building an attendance system using face detection involves data collection, model training, and real-time implementation. With the right approach and tools, you can create an efficient and reliable system.
